For this project the purpose was making an agent that could make its way through a maze through deep q-learning.
I was given most of the code to make this work but had to create the code for the learning system for the agent. This included creating the loop for the system and the reward system in it to make the agent learn as it works.

Computer scientist are problem solvers for problems that can be solved using code and computer systems. This matters because technology in the world is advancing quickly which means more problems to be solved and being able to solve ones that couldnt be before as the technology to solve them comes out.
As a computer scienctist I approach problems by trying to break them apart into pieces that I can work on in steps. This makes it easier to keep things organized and say focused on what my goal is.
My responabilities are to fulfill the task given to me by my organization while maiing systems that are easy to use and safe to use for end users. This means not doing anything unethical like preditory data capture from end users.
